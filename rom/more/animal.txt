Animals
=======
- From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions,
animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are  able to move, reproduce sexually, and grow from
a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal 
species have been described-of which around 1 million are insectsâ€”but it has been estimated there are 
over 7 million in total. Animals range in size from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft) 
long and have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs.
The study of animals is called zoology.
